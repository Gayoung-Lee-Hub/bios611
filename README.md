### Dataset:

House Sales in King County, USA <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction> From Kaggle.

I aimed to explore the significant factors influencing house prices in King County during 2014-2015 using the house sales dataset.

I intended to conduct an analysis that incorporates geographic information utilizing latitude and longitude, along with information about the houses themselves, such as the year built, number of bedrooms, and grade. This comprehensive analysis seeks to understand the various elements affecting house prices during the specified period.

### Build docker container:

docker build -t bios611 .
```

Create a docker container.

```         
docker run -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/ -e PASSWORD=yourpassword --rm -p 8787:8787 bios611
```

Use the browser <http://localhost:8787> on your machine to access the development environment.

3.  Run the following command on the terminal.
